# Fox Valley Special Recreation Forms
Incident Report Forms for Fox Valley Special Recreation

# Getting Started
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/csc4350-fox-valley-bjlz/FoxValleyDemo
```
Run this command from the directory that you would like to clone this repository to. Alternatively you could specify this repository in the new project prompt in Webstorm.

These forms have some Bootstrap classes applied to their HTML elements. I used npm to pull Bootstrap into the project and included it in the package.json, so to get Bootstrap you should be able to run the command:
```shell
$ npm install
```

You can start by looking at **Pages/Login.html**
